## Spectrum Messaging
 
A messaging app that communicates the emotion behind a text to the user.

# Motivation

As a person who stuggles to understand the emotional context of a text message, I would like an app which tells me directly what the tone of each message is.

# Installation
  `npm install`
  
  Then launch from `npm start`
  
# Usage
Once the app is launched in the browser, login or sign-up on the authorization page. Once you're in, feel free to type in the chat input and send and receive messages. Left click on the page and navigate to the inspect tab, where the tonality will be described in the console log.
